# AkahaGesture

Simple app for gesture drawing, similar to quickposes.com, but using your own photos/images, and (currently) without any stats.

Warning: The code is not pretty - it's just a quickly hacked up tool to solve a particluar need.
I just got tired of the limited number of models on quickposes, and the fancy clothings and poses,
so I wrote this tool.

# Usage

Select image/photo files you want to draw, set interval and how many images you want to draw, click start.
The app will randomly draw a set of images from the ones you selected, and display it to you one after another.
